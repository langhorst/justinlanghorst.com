What goes well with notebooks? Pens! Since my last post was about notebooks, it only makes sense for this one to be about pens. Right? Right.

Earlier this year I was on an all out yetti hunt to find the perfect notebook after Moleskine completely screwed their previously lovely square-ruled notebook with ink dark enough to compete with my own writing. The quest was successful after I found my perfect notebook in the [Behance Dot Grid Journal](http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/product/33/dot-grid-journal). The bright green strap just does it for me.

For the _Dot Grid Journal_, my favorite pen so far is the [Papermate Flair UF](http://www.amazon.com/Papermate-Flair-Porous-Point-Assorted/dp/B001GXHG2U/). The [Fisher Space Pen](http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Space-Pen-Non-Reflective-SM4B/dp/B001NXDFC8/) is great if you're into ballpoints, as is the [Parker Jotter](http://www.amazon.com/Parker-Jotter-Stainless-Medium-PAR13333/dp/B001603YXI/). And while I have the stainless steel version, I far prefer the lime green (yes, bright green is a favorite color of mine). The weight and feel is a bit different too, and I actually like the colored plastic versions better.

If I were still writing on Moleskines, there is no question what pen I would be using: the [Pilot Hi-Tec-C](http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-G-Tec-C-Rolling-5-Pack-35480/dp/B0058NN4BG/). And to make things more interesting, there have been a few successful [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com) projects for better housings.

  * [Pen Type-A](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cwandt/pen-type-a-a-minimal-pen?ref=live)
  * [PHX-1](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/klinkokids/phx-1-design-tool-set?ref=live)
  * [Render K](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/karaskustoms/render-k-a-custom-machined-pen?ref=live)
  * [PHX-Pen](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/klinkokids/phx-pen?ref=live)

My choice would be the _Render K_. Just something about it. I haven't felt like forking over $40 just yet though. Hmmm, the _PHX-Pen_ looks interesting as well. Decisions, decisions.
