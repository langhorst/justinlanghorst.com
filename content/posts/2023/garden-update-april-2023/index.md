The Greenthread, Bluebonnets and Winecups have been blooming for a while now. It's so lovely to come into the driveway and be surrounded by this.

Lots of Indian blanket waiting to pop. And lots of sideoats grama from last year.

I've been trying to stay on top of the Hedge parsley but man it's a lot. Hopefully it won't be as bad next year / trying to catch it before it goes to seed.
