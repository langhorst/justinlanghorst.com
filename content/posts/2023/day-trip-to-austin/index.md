I've been meaning to post something for a while. An update. A sign of life. Something that says a little something about what I've been doing lately. The answer is simply: a lot.

Today was significant. Many days have been significant, lately. But today in particular was further validation that what Iâ€™ve been spending my time and energy on is the right path. That I'm exactly where I need to be.

I was sitting in a room full of extremely talented, creative individuals today. Painters, musicians, AI artists, writers, coders, art collectors, founders and who knows what else. I felt at home.

Lately I've been spending my time around a bunch of naturalists, learning about all of the fauna and flora that exist naturally in Dallas. In Texas. How they interact. What to plant. What to eat. What not to eat, not to plant.

I've been learning about prairie. Oh, sweet, gorgeous and endangered prairie.

I've been learning about natural areas of Dallas combined with random bits of their history. I feel very much at home with these people and places, too.

I'm getting back into yoga. Back into running. I'm coding. I'm reading. I'm writing. I'm fucking. I'm loving.

Loving, most importantly. And what I'm loving more than anything lately is life itself. Existence. Breathing it all in. All of it. All of the people and places, natural things and emotions. All of the awesomeness and stupidity. All of it.
