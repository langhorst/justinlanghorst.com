> A moment of self-compassion can change your entire day. A string of such moments can change the course of your life.
> -- Christopher K. Germer

A practical example: *be sweet to yourself*. Remind yourself as many times as you need throughout the day, every day.

I met a yoga teacher a few years ago who would say this in nearly every class. It was such a wonderful thing to hear spoken out loud even though it was a lesson I had already taken to heart years ago. The specific phrase of "be sweet to yourself" resonated strongly and has stuck. I suppose there's often more work to when it comes to self-compassion.

Love yourself, unconditionally.
