> People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that’s what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that’s holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you’ll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake.
> -- Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat Pray Love

I've met a few of these gorgeous people in my life, and smack me awake they did. Amazing.

A good friend of mine gave me this book to read, because I probably wouldn't have read it had they not. But oh! I’m so glad I did! What a delightful read this one is!
