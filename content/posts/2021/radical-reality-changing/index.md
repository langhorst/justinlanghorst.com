The thing about radically changing your reality is that it is likely out of your present awareness. And that's okay because the journey getting there is the best part anyway, living in the present moment. So after you figure out what you want in life, you gotta get out in the world and do something that you feel will lead you there, being open to receive and having faith in the process itself. Enjoy it.

> Your job isn't to know the how, it's to know the what and to be open to discovery, and receiving, the how.

> You have to change your thinking first and then the evidence appears. Our big mistake is that we do it the other way around. We demand to see the evidence before we believe it to be true.
