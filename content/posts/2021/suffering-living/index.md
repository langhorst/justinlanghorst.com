> The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of trick learned while mastering the art of living.
> -- Viktor Frankl, *Man's Search for Meaning*

To find humor in moments of suffering is an art worth mastering. If we have the power to choose how we think about things in any given situation or set of circumstances (and we do!), finding humor in suffering feels an awful lot like living.

As Frankl writes in *Man's Search for Meaning*, while suffering is not necessary to find meaning in life, it's unavoidable. Yet avoidable suffering is masochistic rather than heroic.

And while I've certainly learned a ton about myself through avoidable suffering, I'd also agree that those actions were anything but heroic. They were fun though. And I find great joy and humor in the memories of the ridiculousness.

Maybe well-timed bouts of masochism are important for me? Maybe they are part of my dharma? ðŸ˜„ Maybe it's time I sign up for that hundo I've been thinking about running? ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
