> Gratitude is the wine for the soul. Go on. Get drunk.
> -- Rumi

I've been having not the greatest last few days. I've been in a bit of a mental funk and can't seem to find a way out of it. That is, I was until I found flow while writing gratitude letters this evening.

I was sitting, remote working at a brewery today, attempting to design a feature for a software application I'm building. I had been there for hours; tired, low energy, unable to focus. And so I decided to change it up in the moment and began writing gratitude letters I've been meaning to write.

It changed everything. I found flow. I found the present moment again. And of course it always feels awesome to practice gratitude.

I started a daily gratitude practice several years ago when I discovered the Five Minute Journal. But Iâ€™ve merely been sipping on gratitude. So I think I'll take Rumi's advice for a while and drink a few bottles of gratitude daily.
