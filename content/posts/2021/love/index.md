> Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.
> -- Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

This is the truth as told by so many poets, the final wisdom of so many thinkers.

What is love? (baby don't ...) Hah, no. What is unconditional love? Everything. Love is everything.

> The salvation of man is through love and in love.

I consider myself extremely fortunate in that I've been able to experience this endless vibrational wave that is love permeating through my body and everything around me. I'm thinking of a particular moment that left me in a state of pure bliss. One that I've never experienced so forcefully before this moment. A moment where I could do nothing else but float in an ocean of my own tears.

Love is all around us. It permeates everything. Connecting to it is the challenge.

I've been working on getting out of my head and into my body, on being present and connecting with this purest form of energy as much as I am able.

Gratitude and meditation.
