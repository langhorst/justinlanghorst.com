True happiness for me comes in connecting deeply with people. Through watching people really come into themselves. To see them living authentically, to live in integrity with themselves, to be as much of themselves as they can possibly be. And to see them getting out there, and fucking getting it.

Be true to yourself and be your true self and happiness seems to come along for the ride.
