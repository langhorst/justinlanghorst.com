> It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.
> -- AndrÃ© Gide

I need you to really, truly believe that you are unique and possess precious gifts to share with the world. Why? Because it's true. And. Because the world becomes even more gorgeous than it already is when you do.

Let go of negative self-talk. Let go of comparison with others. Let go of guilt, resentment and criticism. Learn your lessons and forgive yourself.

Embrace being sweet to yourself. Embrace the things you love simply because they are fun and bring pleasure. Embrace compassion, joy and gratitude.

Why?

Because why not? Is all that stuff from your past really serving you? No, then let that shit go!!

In doing so you find purpose. You go from lost to found. And you show up as your fucking Self.
