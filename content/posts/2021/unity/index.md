> Be Americans. Let there be no sectionalism, no North, South, East or West. You are all dependent on one another and should be one in union. In one word, be a nation. Be Americans, and be true to yourselves.
> -- George Washington

Personally, I'd go broader. Be humans. Practice curiosity and understanding. Practice compassion.
