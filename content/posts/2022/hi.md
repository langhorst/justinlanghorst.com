Hi! It's time to refresh things once again. I've reached 40 years of age, am definitely a different person than I was over 20 years ago when I first started posting on the internet. I have big plans for the next decade and beyond. And to begin, I'm collecting a lot of my random posts on the internet over the last 20 years and back-filling this site with this random content. Enjoy. Or don't. I hope you do you.
