This is the story of a 30 hour moving meditation. More or less.

* Originally gonna run it
* Decided to pace instead
* Oh I’m crewing too? Okay!
* Pack drop bags night before
* Got to sleep around 8
* Woke up at 3:20
* Drove to start, arrived by 415
* Took some photos, listened to the pre-race report
* Race started at 5, off they go!
* Back to the hotel!
* Nap. Yoga. Shower. Breakfast.
* Back to Beal’s Point!
* Met up with Karen and Steve (and Sophie!) Josh and Cara arrived not too long afterwards.
* Went around the corner to sit on a bench and wait for them to come in. Drank some coffee.
* They arrived strong and full of smiles!
* Quick change of bottles and they’re off again!
* Talked with everyone for a bit longer and then we all went on to the next aid station. Granite Beach.
* Ray and Jourdan arrived at the aid station not long after we arrived. Again, quick bottle change and they were off.
* Drove to Rattlesnake Bar. Sat and waited around for a while but they got in within predicted time. Still looking great. Still full of smiles.
* Packed up and found a place to eat. A deli place about a mile away from Overlook. Had a large turkey sandwich, probably too large. And tea.
* We then made our way to Overlook and Karen was thinking they were going to be in within 15 minutes or so, so I changed in a hurry. And then I waited, and waited, and waited some more. I was ready to go! But at the same time glad that they were running behind because I needed to expunge some food from my body. And I did. And I felt ready to go.
* They finally made it in and took their time talking with everybody as this would be the last time everyone was still around.
* And then we were off! They used the bathroom real quick and then after letting food settle we ran/hiked the next 4.5 miles to No Hands Bridge.
* It was there when things started to go downhill for Ray.
* After walking out of the aid station Ray needed a minute.
