Meeting people on the trail and exploring the community aspect of trail running is one of my favorite things to do during [[ultramarathons]].

I had been trying to find earbud tips for days, and luckily found the missing tip the evening before the race. I put my earbuds around my beck before the race, and they sat there unused until around mile 10.5 when I made my first and only call during the race to [[Sarah Langhorst]]. No answer. I spent a few minutes listening to a podcast and then decided I’d rather be with nature than somewhere else. Several miles later I would lose that earbud tip again, this time, for good.

Miles 11-26 were honestly a blur. I eventually caught up to [[Ray Liberatore]] who was moving slowly up the mountain before the descent to Frog Pond. He informed me that [[Jourdan Esquenazi]] was no more than a half-mile ahead, and so I pushed on, running the downhills as they came.

I finally caught up to Jourdan on my way into the Frog Pond aid-station as she was running out. After a quick refuel, and a bunch of ice in my hat and Buff around my neck, and with a couple of cups of Coke, I was back on the trail. The way back out of Frog Pond is where I lost my earbud tip once again — damn.

The next push is where I would catch up to Jourdan. She was having issues getting her heart rate to come down, and I was like the stealthy predator cat making ground while her back was turned. Of course I went in for the kill by offering to rest and eat with her :-). And then, then I took the lead of our Texas group.

My first fall, which wasn’t even a proper fall, was on the trip down to Warren Lake. Everything slipped but my left leg, which saved me from falling but pushed my left calf muscle to complete exhaustion, where it immediately seized up. It took a few minutes of breathing into it to get it functional again. After that, I decided that maybe it would be best to slow it down and take the descent a little more carefully, as the great Peter RD suggested in our pre-race meeting.

Making it to the bottom was awesome, with heavy metal blasting, and all of the AS volunteers screaming “Welcome to the bottom!” upon arrival.

Oh! Say something about congratulating people on the out and back sections — “Great work, man!” — honestly this is the thing I missed most about not being able to continue. I absolutely love congratulating every single fucking person that crosses my path during a race. It brings me such tremendous energy — the greatest positive vibes.

Jourdan joined me at Warren Lake about 10 minutes after I arrived. I decided to wade in, taking my shoes and socks off beforehand. Because — I mean, MOUNTAIN LAKE! Have you experienced how beautiful and pristine remote mountain lakes are? Because let me tell you, they are one the most awesome things I have experienced in my life.

Anyway, I saw Ray on my way back out of Warren Lake, telling him that Jourdan was thinking about calling it — the highlight of her trip being Warren Lake, she wanted to spend a decent amount of time there. I certainly got it and didn’t argue. Ray encouraged me to keep pushing on, and I did … until …

I started slipping and sliding on the silt down from Castle Peak. This was the first time in the race that I experienced less than positive emotions, and this is the section that really did me in.

[[Castle Peak 100K 2021]]. This was a race that was suppose to happen a year prior, but like many things, the pandemic had other ideas (for the race, and humanity in general). This year had a bit of drama leading up to it. Wildfires and the resulting air quality. Our team of three from Texas flew into Tahoe ready for a good time, race or no race.

My training was not up to my standards leading up to the day. I just couldn’t seem to get it together, couldn’t seem to dig deep enough to put the work in consistently. There were many reasons for this, none important for this particular story. But because of this, I told myself that it would be okay — that I would just go out and have fun — that I would do my best, whatever that was. I gave myself grace. And sometimes, this is absolutely what’s needed. Other time, it’s absolute bullshit and I need to figure out how to get it together and get it done. The only way to know if you’re telling yourself a lie is to know yourself. This seems to be a lifelong pursuit. I didn’t know it until after the race was over, but I had been telling myself a big fucking lie.

The race started straight up a hill void of any real trail. Loose soil. Lots of dust, which was only a problem if you started near the back like I did. The other issue with that was having to wait far too long for other runners to slowly climb the hill, a traffic jam at the beginning of the race. I forgot to bring gaiters with me, so after making it to the top of the hill, I sat down and emptied my shoes of tiny rocks and sand (of pebbles and sand). These few mistakes set me back by 10 minutes.

The view up top was awesome. My favorite image was of a Star Wars-looking ski lift, red light inside, against the backdrop of a morning sunrise. So cool. This section of the trail was easy, smooth, and so I made sure to pick things up a bit to bank some time.

Tushars. Meeting [[Kylie Aldaz]]. Telling her about my upcoming Castle Peak — and how I wasn’t attached to my results. And feeling like I had told her a lie. I should have listened closer to this. Sometimes its helpful to talk to somebody else — to say whatever you’re thinking — to have a mirror.

Castle Peak — going at my own pace. Seeing Adam. Accepting help. My headphones. And so much more!
