Meeting people on the trail and exploring the community aspect of trail running is one of my favorite things to do during [[ultramarathons]].

I had been trying to find earbud tips for days, and luckily found the missing tip the evening before the race. I put my earbuds around my beck before the race, and they sat there unused until around mile 10.5 when I made my first and only call during the race to [[Sarah Langhorst]]. No answer. I spent a few minutes listening to a podcast and then decided I’d rather be with nature than somewhere else. Several miles later I would lose that earbud tip again, this time, for good.

Miles 11-26 were honestly a blur. I eventually caught up to [[Ray Liberatore]] who was moving slowly up the mountain before the descent to Frog Pond. He informed me that [[Jourdan Esquenazi]] was no more than a half-mile ahead, and so I pushed on, running the downhills as they came.

I finally caught up to Jourdan on my way into the Frog Pond aid-station as she was running out. After a quick refuel, and a bunch of ice in my hat and Buff around my neck, and with a couple of cups of Coke, I was back on the trail. The way back out of Frog Pond is where I lost my earbud tip once again — damn.

The next push is where I would catch up to Jourdan. She was having issues getting her heart rate to come down, and I was like the stealthy predator cat making ground while her back was turned. Of course I went in for the kill by offering to rest and eat with her :-). And then, then I took the lead of our Texas group.

My first fall, which wasn’t even a proper fall, was on the trip down to Warren Lake. Everything slipped but my left leg, which saved me from falling but pushed my left calf muscle to complete exhaustion, where it immediately seized up. It took a few minutes of breathing into it to get it functional again. After that, I decided that maybe it would be best to slow it down and take the descent a little more carefully, as the great Peter RD suggested in our pre-race meeting.

Making it to the bottom was awesome, with heavy metal blasting, and all of the AS volunteers screaming “Welcome to the bottom!” upon arrival.

Oh! Say something about congratulating people on the out and back sections — “Great work, man!” — honestly this is the thing I missed most about not being able to continue. I absolutely love congratulating every single fucking person that crosses my path during a race. It brings me such tremendous energy — the greatest positive vibes.

Jourdan joined me at Warren Lake about 10 minutes after I arrived. I decided to wade in, taking my shoes and socks off beforehand. Because — I mean, MOUNTAIN LAKE! Have you experienced how beautiful and pristine remote mountain lakes are? Because let me tell you, they are one the most awesome things I have experienced in my life.

Anyway, I saw Ray on my way back out of Warren Lake, telling him that Jourdan was thinking about calling it — the highlight of her trip being Warren Lake, she wanted to spend a decent amount of time there. I certainly got it and didn’t argue. Ray encouraged me to keep pushing on, and I did … until …

I started slipping and sliding on the silt down from Castle Peak. This was the first time in the race that I experienced less than positive emotions, and this is the section that really did me in.
