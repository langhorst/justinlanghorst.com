One of the reasons I sign up to toe the line of ultra-marathons is for the experience of the adventure. The nature. The people. The camaraderie of the trail running community.

Another more personal reason: ultra-marathons provide the opportunity to get to know myself on much deeper levels. How do I respond physically, mentally and emotionally when the suck inevitably begins? How long am I able to push through, and when do I begin to fall apart?

The knowledge gained from these lessons so easily apply to daily life. The better I get to know myself, the easier it becomes to feel into my intuition and make decisions that help fulfill my purpose.

The 2021 Castle Peak 100K did not disappoint for either: it was both a wonderful opportunity to get to know myself AND it was a wonderful adventure with friends both old and new.

- this race taught me so much about myself ... sometimes telling the truth to yourself is incredibly difficult because you want to believe one thing when the reality is another ... this is especially true when there isn't much you can do about it in the moment. or, so you think.
- What is the point of this post? Primarily, to talk about mindset, and knowing yourself.
- Sometimes you can use your physical training to get you past a particularly tough event. And sometimes you can use your mental training. In this race, it was both, until it wasn't.


## Training.

Castle Peak is thought to be the hardest 100K in the continental United States. Showing up to the starting line not physically and mentally prepared is not advisable. And while I felt my physical training leading up to the race to be severely lacking, I showed up anyway. ;-)

My 2021 entry was a carryover from 2020 when I had originally signed up for the race. While I was more physically prepared for success in 2020, my personal life had become hectic in the months prior so I was more than a little relieved of the cancellation due to the pandemic.

2021 came along and while I knew I should be putting in significant miles during training, I could never seem to get into the habit of doing so.

The success of my previous 100K years prior was largely due to practicing yoga in the studio 4-5 times a week along with regular strength training with kettlebells and regular running. I was fit. I was strong. And while I had continued to practice each, my consistency of doing so was drastically reduced in the year leading up to the race.

?? maybe?
So why couldn't I get it together? Too much running alone. I prefer to have a group to run with regularly. A group where we share common goals. Where we can both run together and do our own thing all the same. But this was difficult during the pandemic, and so the training that I did put in was mostly on my own. And it was sparse.

Yet, two trips earlier in the year served up confidence.

### Guadalupe Mountains + Carlsbad Caverns with my Father-in-Law.

I spent a few days in the Guadalupe Mountains and Carlsbad Caverns National Parks with my father-in-law in early May of 2021. I was fit enough to get up to Guadalupe Peak and back down in good time. This was promising.

The only mistake I made was not re-applying sunblock at Guadalupe Peak. I underestimated the intensity of the sun at this time of year and received a serious sunburn as a result. Whoops.

While the severe sunburn limited the amount of running I had planned in the mountains, I was able to grab an unexpected run from the bottom of Carlsbad Caverns up to the top. It was a nice little hill run, avoiding the sun in the cool darkness of the caverns.

### Tushars Mountains + Humphreys Peak with Friends.

Luckily I had a trip out into

- coming into the first aid station with crew, seeing adam, accepting help.

### Johnson Canyon to Summit Lake.

- donnor lake. adam said not to miss the view, because it's incredible. and it was.
- [photo] 2021.08.14 08:51.
- it was around this time that i threw my earbuds in to call Sarah, listen to a podcast. but it wasn't that far into the race ... so ...

### Summit Lake to Frog Lake.

- i had caught up to Ray by this point, on the way up before the way down to the next aid station. he was looking pretty tired at the time, and honestly I was worried about him given his race history.
- on the way to the aid station, I saw Jourdan coming back up. this ended up being a particularly important aid station, as i was able to load myself down with ice, something i desperately needed at the time.
- and then Ray comes flying into the aid station not far behind me ... wtf man?

### Frog Lake to Warren Lake.

- and then i lose my earbud tip for good. damn.
- [photo] 2021.08.14 12:23. time to stalk Jourdan.
- busting up hills, can't fucking breathe, trying to eat a bag of chips on the way up, but it's really hard to chew on chips and try to breathe at the same time. try it.
- and this is where it starts going downhill ... on the way to THE BOTTOM. down to the lake. it was so fucking beautiful. the RD warned us. told us not to be Adam Kimble. told us to take it slow. and he was right. because at some point I slipped but caught myself with my leg, but I totally maxed out my calf muscle doing this. it took me a few minutes to get it back ... nothing seemed to be wrong, but I could see this becoming problematic later in the race.

### Warren Lake (The BOTTOM).

- WELCOME TO THE BOTTOM. write about the dedication of the trail running community, and how the volunteers of this aid station had to hike out several miles and so many feet of elevation in extremely technical terrain to make this happen. yeah. fuck yeah.
- [photo] 2021.08.14 13:59. THE BOTTOM. a dip in the lake.

Warren Lake is a fucking destination. For Jourdan, it was essentially her end.


### Warren Lake to Castle Valley (The END for Me).

## Post-Race.

## Thoughts.

- getting back out of the bottom ...
- Meeting ... the doctor. He's throwing up on the side of the trail and I ask him how he's doing ... "how do you think I'm doing?" haha ... well ...
- [photo] 2021.08.14 15:48. The Ridgeline.
- the doctor catches up to me, thanks me for stopping earlier, and tells me about the trail a bit and what's up ahead. I'm slowing down. My thoughts aren't as positive by this point. This is a hard fucking race.
- I start slipping. Crap. Scree. Fuck. By this point I'm not as positive as I once was, especially after the slip on the way to the bottom. This is where I really start letting my positive mindset slow, and letting the thoughts of dropping at the next aid station.
- me and the doctor talk again ... I didn't realize we were so close to the cutoff or I probably would have picked it up, but ... he is going for it ... he is deadset on making the cutoff ... sometimes I wonder what's going through people's heads, why they are so adamant about pushing through -- what drives them (I'd find out later).
- 

- know yourself.
- physical limits. mental limits.
- feel the lies.
- tell the truth.
- the race details.
- summary.




Tushars. Meeting [[Kylie Aldaz]]. Telling her about my upcoming Castle Peak — and how I wasn't attached to my results. And feeling like I had told her a lie. I should have listened closer to this. Sometimes its helpful to talk to somebody else — to say whatever you’re thinking — to have a mirror.

By the way. I think the Tushars 100K edges out Castle Peak, grabbing the top spot for the toughest 100K in the United States. It's sheer ridiculousness. And I've only done 20 miles of it.



Castle Peak was a reminder of how important it is to know thyself. A reminder to consistently check-in to my body when I'm in conversation. How does what I'm saying make me feel? And as a result, a reminder to tell myself the fucking truth.

I spent a good portion of the summer traveling around the southwest. Sometimes by myself. Sometimes with others. Always a good time.




Trail running has always been about getting to know myself. In my 20s it was one of the only major tools I had -- one that I used and certainly abused. In the last several years it's been less that -- I've added mindset, meditation, yoga and journaling into the mix. So when I failed to go through a particular training regimen to put myself in the best physical shape possible for the race, I gave up. 

Trail running has always been about getting to know myself. This race was no different, and the months leading up to it were a surprising amount of telling myself a big fucking lie.


One of the major destinations of my trip was the Tushars mountain range in southern Utah to pace my buddy for the Tushars 100k race, thought to be the hardest 100k in the country.

It was early in my 20 miles of pacing that we met another runner and her pacer. The pacer was getting ready for Leadville, and me, for Castle Peak. Later in the night we met up again and we shared a bit of the trail, enjoying each other's commpany along the way.

I remember a part of this conversation well, because it came back so vividly over and over. Here was a person I admired ... I admired her training, and her dedication to putting herself in the best shape for being successful. At least physically, but it seemed, mentally as well.

And I remember telling this person about how I didn't really care of I finished. Primarily, I was out there to have fun. My training leading up to the race weren't up to my standards. And by saying all of 

What did I say?

I told her that my training hadn't been up to my standards. That for whatever reason I've had trouble putting in the training lately. Maybe because I'd been busy with other things in life that had taken precedence. And because of this, I was just going to go out there and have fun. To do my best, whatever that was.

But this was a lie. It didn't feel right coming out of my mouth then. It didn't feel right speaking it later to our trio from Texas, and it certainly didn't feel right after I DNF'd. I'll get to that.

It wasn't until a day after the race that I felt the significance of getting pulled from the race within my body. I was fucking bummed. And I was bummed because I knew I didn't give it my best. I didn't give it my best leading up to the race, and I didn't give it my best on the day. I allowed very minor issues to drive my thoughts into the negative and then I began diving into the narrative of stopping at the next aid station.

I'd had my fun. It was time to go spend time with friends. Everyone else had dropped by this point, so it would just be me out there. Fuck.



Meeting people on the trail and exploring the community aspect of trail running is one of my favorite things to do during ultramarathons. 

I had been trying to find earbud tips for days, and luckily found the missing tip the evening before the race. I put my earbuds around my beck before the race, and they sat there unused until around mile 10.5 when I made my first and only call during the race to [[Sarah Langhorst]]. No answer. I spent a few minutes listening to a podcast and then decided I’d rather be with nature than somewhere else. Several miles later I would lose that earbud tip again, this time, for good.

Miles 11-26 were honestly a blur. I eventually caught up to [[Ray Liberatore]] who was moving slowly up the mountain before the descent to Frog Pond. He informed me that [[Jourdan Esquenazi]] was no more than a half-mile ahead, and so I pushed on, running the downhills as they came.

I finally caught up to Jourdan on my way into the Frog Pond aid-station as she was running out. After a quick refuel, and a bunch of ice in my hat and Buff around my neck, and with a couple of cups of Coke, I was back on the trail. The way back out of Frog Pond is where I lost my earbud tip once again — damn.

The next push is where I would catch up to Jourdan. She was having issues getting her heart rate to come down, and I was like the stealthy predator cat making ground while her back was turned. Of course I went in for the kill by offering to rest and eat with her :-). And then, then I took the lead of our Texas group.

My first fall, which wasn't even a proper fall, was on the trip down to Warren Lake. Everything slipped but my left leg, which saved me from falling but pushed my left calf muscle to complete exhaustion, where it immediately seized up. It took a few minutes of breathing into it to get it functional again. After that, I decided that maybe it would be best to slow it down and take the descent a little more carefully, as the great Peter RD suggested in our pre-race meeting.

Making it to the bottom was awesome, with heavy metal blasting, and all of the AS volunteers screaming “Welcome to the bottom!” upon arrival.

Oh! Say something about congratulating people on the out and back sections — “Great work, man!” — honestly this is the thing I missed most about not being able to continue. I absolutely love congratulating every single fucking person that crosses my path during a race. It brings me such tremendous energy — the greatest positive vibes.

Jourdan joined me at Warren Lake about 10 minutes after I arrived. I decided to wade in, taking my shoes and socks off beforehand. Because — I mean, MOUNTAIN LAKE! Have you experienced how beautiful and pristine remote mountain lakes are? Because let me tell you, they are one the most awesome things I have experienced in my life.

Anyway, I saw Ray on my way back out of Warren Lake, telling him that Jourdan was thinking about calling it — the highlight of her trip being Warren Lake, she wanted to spend a decent amount of time there. I certainly got it and didn’t argue. Ray encouraged me to keep pushing on, and I did … until …

I started slipping and sliding on the silt down from Castle Peak. This was the first time in the race that I experienced less than positive emotions, and this is the section that really did me in.

[[Castle Peak 100K 2021]]. This was a race that was suppose to happen a year prior, but like many things, the pandemic had other ideas (for the race, and humanity in general). This year had a bit of drama leading up to it. Wildfires and the resulting air quality. Our team of three from Texas flew into Tahoe ready for a good time, race or no race.

My training was not up to my standards leading up to the day. I just couldn't seem to get it together, couldn't seem to dig deep enough to put the work in consistently. There were many reasons for this, none important for this particular story. But because of this, I told myself that it would be okay — that I would just go out and have fun — that I would do my best, whatever that was. I gave myself grace. And sometimes, this is absolutely what’s needed. Other time, it's absolute bullshit and I need to figure out how to get it together and get it done. The only way to know if you’re telling yourself a lie is to know yourself. This seems to be a lifelong pursuit. I didn't know it until after the race was over, but I had been telling myself a big fucking lie.

The race started straight up a hill void of any real trail. Loose soil. Lots of dust, which was only a problem if you started near the back like I did. The other issue with that was having to wait far too long for other runners to slowly climb the hill, a traffic jam at the beginning of the race. I forgot to bring gaiters with me, so after making it to the top of the hill, I sat down and emptied my shoes of tiny rocks and sand (of pebbles and sand). These few mistakes set me back by 10 minutes.

The view up top was awesome. My favorite image was of a Star Wars-looking ski lift, red light inside, against the backdrop of a morning sunrise. So cool. This section of the trail was easy, smooth, and so I made sure to pick things up a bit to bank some time.
