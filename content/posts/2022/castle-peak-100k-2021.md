Meeting people on the trail and exploring the community aspect of trail running is one of my favorite things to do during ultramarathons.

I had been trying to find earbud tips for days, and luckily found the missing tip the evening before the race. I put my earbuds around my neck before the race, and they sat unused until around mile 10.5 when I made my first and only call during the race to my wife. No answer. I spent a few minutes listening to a podcast and then decided I'd rather be with nature and my thoughts than anywhere else. Several miles later I would lose that earbud tip again, this time, for good.
