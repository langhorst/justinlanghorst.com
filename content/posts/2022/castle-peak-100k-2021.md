One of the reasons I sign up to both enjoy and suffer through ultra-marathons is for the experience of sheer adventure. The nature. The people. The camaraderie of the trail running community.

Another more personal reason: ultra-marathons provide excellent opportunities to get to know myself on deeper levels.

How do I respond physically, mentally and emotionally when the suck inevitably begins? How long am I able to push through, and when do I begin to fall apart?

And after the race is done and I've had some time to process the experience, what made the experience great? What made it not so great? What could I have done better?

The knowledge gained from these lessons is so easily applied to daily life. The better I get to know myself, the easier it becomes to feel into my intuition and make decisions that further me down the path of fulfilling my life's purpose.

The 2021 Castle Peak 100K did not disappoint in either category: it was both a wonderful opportunity to get to know myself AND a wonderful adventure with friends both old and new.

In particular, this race taught me when I'm speaking the truth, both to myself and others, and when I'm not. Sometimes telling the truth to myself is incredibly difficult because while I want to believe one thing, the reality is exact opposite. This can be an extremely subtle difference in the moment.

In the months leading up to Castle Peak, I had been telling myself that I didn't have anything to prove to myself or anyone else and I would tell myself and anyone who would listen that I was just going out there for the fun of it. I'd love to finish, but if I didn't, no big deal.

But the truth of the matter was that I *did* have something to prove to myself. I *did* want to finish. And saying anything to the contrary was surprisingly a big fucking lie.

## Training.

~~Sometimes you can use your physical training to get you past a particularly tough event. And sometimes you can use your mental training. In this race, it was both, until it wasn't.~~

Castle Peak is arguably the hardest 100K in the continental United States. Showing up to the starting line not physically and mentally prepared is not advisable. And while I felt my physical training leading up to the race to be severely lacking, I showed up anyway. Of course I did ;-)

My 2021 entry was a carryover from 2020 when I had originally signed up for the race. While I was more physically prepared for success in 2020, my personal life had become hectic in the months prior so I was more than a little relieved and grateful for the pandemic's ability to cancel anything it could.

2021 arrived and while I knew I should be putting in significant miles during training, I could never seem to get into the habit of doing so.

The success of my previous 100K in 2019 was largely due to practicing yoga in my local studio 4-5 times a week, regular strength training with kettlebells and of course, consistent running. I was fit. I was strong. These practices led to a successful race.

While I had continued to practice each of these activities for Castle Peak, my consistency of doing so was drastically reduced in the year leading up to the race.

So why couldn't I get it together? Maybe just too much time alone. Not enough opportunities to run with a partner or a group. No yoga studio time. Very little gym time. It's way more fun to do life with other people, and I have enough time alone as it is.

~~lI prefer to have a group to run with regularly. A group where we share common goals. Where we can both run together and do our own thing all the same. But this was difficult during the pandemic, and so the little training that I did put in was mostly on my own.~~

Yet, two trips earlier in the year served up a healthy dose of confidence.

### Guadalupe Mountains + Carlsbad Caverns with my Father-in-Law.

I spent a few days in the Guadalupe Mountains and Carlsbad Caverns National Parks with my father-in-law in early May of 2021. I was fit enough to get up to Guadalupe Peak and back down in good time. This was promising.

The only mistake I made was not re-applying sunblock at Guadalupe Peak. I simply underestimated the intensity of the sun at this time of year.

You can guess what happened running in the middle of the desert without proper sunblock. And if your guess is anything other than the sun loving me too hard, well, I'd love to hear about it. Call me.

While the severe sunburn limited the amount of running I had planned in the mountains, I was fortunately able to grab an unexpected run from the bottom of Carlsbad Caverns up to the top. It was a nice little hill run, avoiding the sun in the cool darkness of the caverns.

### Tushars Mountains + Humphreys Peak with Friends.

- Tushars. Meeting [[Kylie Aldaz]]. Telling her about my upcoming Castle Peak — and how I wasn't attached to my results. And feeling like I had told her a lie. I should have listened closer to this. Sometimes its helpful to talk to somebody else — to say whatever you’re thinking — to have a mirror.
- By the way. I think the Tushars 100K edges out Castle Peak, grabbing the top spot for the toughest 100K in the United States. It's sheer ridiculousness. And I've only done 20 miles of it.

I spent a couple weeks in the summer exploring the great American southwest, driving from my home in Dallas, Texas to Flagstaff, Arizona and then into southern Utah and back.

Utah is where the Tushars 100K is run. This was a major destination on the trip, as I was there to pace a buddy for his first 100K attempt.

One of the major destinations of my trip was the Tushars mountain range in southern Utah to pace a buddy for the Tushars 100K race, thought to be the hardest 100K races in the country by people who have raced both Tushars and Castle Peak.

It was early in my 20 miles of pacing that my runner and I met another runner and her pacer. The pacer was getting ready for Leadville, one of the most well known and difficult 100 milers in the country. Later in the night we met up again and we shared a bit of the trail, enjoying each other's commpany along the way.

I remember a particular aspect of this conversation well, because it came back so vividly before Castle Peak and many times after. Here was a person I admired ... I admired her training, and her dedication to putting herself in the best shape for being successful for a really tough 100 miler. Physically for sure, but it seemed, mentally as well.

I told her that my training hadn't been up to my standards. That for whatever reason I've had trouble putting in the miles lately. Maybe because I'd been busy with other things in life that had taken precedence. Maybe, something else entirely. And because of this, I was just going to go out there and have fun. To do my best, whatever that was.

But this was a lie. It didn't feel right coming out of my mouth then. And it certainly didn't feel right right speaking it any time later.

Remember earlier in this lil' diddy when I said that the Castle Peak 100K is arguably the hardest 100K in the continental United States? Well. After doing 20 miles in the Tushar Mountains, I'd argue that the Castle Peak 100K loses out to the Tushars 100K, at least in the difficulty of terrain.

My friend and I had a good time, if you consider suffering together a good time. I do. He do. We do. AND I was able to grab 20 miles in various conditions at elevation which proved to be excellent preparation for my own race.

A few days later, back in Flagstaff, and now joined by one of my bestest friends that surprised me by flying in from Florida, a group of us fast hiked up to the tippy top of Arizona: Humphreys Peak. More excellent training. More good times.

Ultra-marathons pay off in many ways. This particular bout of travel led to new friends, deeper relationships, and travel into an area of the country I had never been before and deeply fell in love with.

We took a small tour of the crewable aid stations before heading to the pre-race meeting. 


## The Race.

### The Start to Johnson Canyon (Hills on a gorgeous morning)

- to the top.

[[Castle Peak 100K 2021]]. This was a race that was suppose to happen a year prior, but like many things, the pandemic had other ideas (for the race, and humanity in general). This year had a bit of drama leading up to it. Wildfires and the resulting air quality. Our team of three from Texas flew into Tahoe ready for a good time, race or no race.

My training was not up to my standards leading up to the day. I just couldn't seem to get it together, couldn't seem to dig deep enough to put the work in consistently. There were many reasons for this, none important for this particular story. But because of this, I told myself that it would be okay — that I would just go out and have fun — that I would do my best, whatever that was. I gave myself grace. And sometimes, this is absolutely what’s needed. Other time, it's absolute bullshit and I need to figure out how to get it together and get it done. The only way to know if you’re telling yourself a lie is to know yourself. This seems to be a lifelong pursuit. I didn't know it until after the race was over, but I had been telling myself a big fucking lie.

The race started straight up a hill void of any real trail. Loose soil. Lots of dust, which was only a problem if you started near the back like I did. The other issue with that was having to wait far too long for other runners to slowly climb the hill, a traffic jam at the beginning of the race. I forgot to bring gaiters with me, so after making it to the top of the hill, I sat down and emptied my shoes of tiny rocks and sand (of pebbles and sand). These few mistakes set me back by 10 minutes.

The view up top was awesome. My favorite image was of a Star Wars-looking ski lift, red light inside, against the backdrop of a morning sunrise. So cool. This section of the trail was easy, smooth, and so I made sure to pick things up a bit to bank some time.

### Johnson Canyon to Summit Lake.

- donnor lake. adam said not to miss the view, because it's incredible. and it was.

- it was around this time that i threw my earbuds in to call Sarah, listen to a podcast. but it wasn't that far into the race ... so ...

### Summit Lake to Frog Lake.

- i had caught up to Ray by this point, on the way up before the way down to the next aid station. he was looking pretty tired at the time, and honestly I was worried about him given his race history.
- on the way to the aid station, I saw Jourdan coming back up. this ended up being a particularly important aid station, as i was able to load myself down with ice, something i desperately needed at the time.
- and then Ray comes flying into the aid station not far behind me ... wtf man?

Meeting people on the trail and exploring the community aspect of trail running is one of my favorite things to do during ultramarathons. 

I had been trying to find earbud tips for days, and luckily found the missing tip the evening before the race. I put my earbuds around my beck before the race, and they sat there unused until around mile 10.5 when I made my first and only call during the race to [[Sarah Langhorst]]. No answer. I spent a few minutes listening to a podcast and then decided I’d rather be with nature than somewhere else. Several miles later I would lose that earbud tip again, this time, for good.

Miles 11-26 were honestly a blur. I eventually caught up to [[Ray Liberatore]] who was moving slowly up the mountain before the descent to Frog Pond. He informed me that [[Jourdan Esquenazi]] was no more than a half-mile ahead, and so I pushed on, running the downhills as they came.

I finally caught up to Jourdan on my way into the Frog Pond aid-station as she was running out. After a quick refuel, and a bunch of ice in my hat and Buff around my neck, and with a couple of cups of Coke, I was back on the trail. The way back out of Frog Pond is where I lost my earbud tip once again — damn.

### Frog Lake to Warren Lake.

- and then i lose my earbud tip for good. damn.
- [photo] 2021.08.14 12:23. time to stalk Jourdan.
- busting up hills, can't fucking breathe, trying to eat a bag of chips on the way up, but it's really hard to chew on chips and try to breathe at the same time. try it.
- and this is where it starts going downhill ... on the way to THE BOTTOM. down to the lake. it was so fucking beautiful. the RD warned us. told us not to be Adam Kimble. told us to take it slow. and he was right. because at some point I slipped but caught myself with my leg, but I totally maxed out my calf muscle doing this. it took me a few minutes to get it back ... nothing seemed to be wrong, but I could see this becoming problematic later in the race.
- [photo] 2021.08.14 13:48.

The next push is where I would catch up to Jourdan. She was having issues getting her heart rate to come down, and I was like the stealthy predator cat making ground while her back was turned. Of course I went in for the kill by offering to rest and eat with her :-). And then, then I took the lead of our Texas group.

My first fall, which wasn't even a proper fall, was on the trip down to Warren Lake. Everything slipped but my left leg, which saved me from falling but pushed my left calf muscle to complete exhaustion, where it immediately seized up. It took a few minutes of breathing into it to get it functional again. After that, I decided that maybe it would be best to slow it down and take the descent a little more carefully, as the great Peter RD suggested in our pre-race meeting.

Making it to the bottom was awesome, with heavy metal blasting, and all of the AS volunteers screaming “Welcome to the bottom!” upon arrival.

Oh! Say something about congratulating people on the out and back sections — “Great work, man!” — honestly this is the thing I missed most about not being able to continue. I absolutely love congratulating every single fucking person that crosses my path during a race. It brings me such tremendous energy — the greatest positive vibes.

Jourdan joined me at Warren Lake about 10 minutes after I arrived. I decided to wade in, taking my shoes and socks off beforehand. Because — I mean, MOUNTAIN LAKE! Have you experienced how beautiful and pristine remote mountain lakes are? Because let me tell you, they are one the most awesome things I have experienced in my life.

### Warren Lake (The BOTTOM).

- WELCOME TO THE BOTTOM. write about the dedication of the trail running community, and how the volunteers of this aid station had to hike out several miles and so many feet of elevation in extremely technical terrain to make this happen. yeah. fuck yeah.
- [photo] 2021.08.14 13:59. THE BOTTOM. a dip in the lake.

Warren Lake is a fucking destination. For Jourdan, it was essentially her end.


### Warren Lake to Castle Valley (The END for Me).

Anyway, I saw Ray on my way back out of Warren Lake, telling him that Jourdan was thinking about calling it — the highlight of her trip being Warren Lake, she wanted to spend a decent amount of time there. I certainly got it and didn’t argue. Ray encouraged me to keep pushing on, and I did … until …

I started slipping and sliding on the silt down from Castle Peak. This was the first time in the race that I experienced less than positive emotions, and this is the section that really did me in.


- getting back out of the bottom ...
- Meeting ... the doctor. He's throwing up on the side of the trail and I ask him how he's doing ... "how do you think I'm doing?" haha ... well ...
- [photo] 2021.08.14 15:48. The Ridgeline.

My way out of Warren Lake was much less eventful than my way down. I was near the back of the pack in terms of people who were on time to finish. One of my Texas buddy's was heading down into Warren Lake as I was climbing out, wishing me good luck and pushing me to keep going.

At this point, I was in good spirits. It's usually not hard for me to maintain this attitude for a considerable amount of time.

On my way up into the epic ridgelines of the race, I came across a gentleman puking his guts out on the side of the trail. I asked him how he was doing, which he reasonably responded, "how does it look like I'm doing!?" And I was like, "yeah, I know man, tell me what you need."

Unfortunately I didn't have what he needed (salt pills), but I did hook him up with some potato chips just in case. There was another runner behind me who had already called his own race and offered to stay and help the gut-emptying gentleman out.

A few miles later on the approach into the ridge lines, he caught up to me, thanking me for earlier and offering some knowledge on the terrain coming up. It's always amazing to me how people can bounce back so quickly after true suffering.

Going up into the ridge lines was just epic, Castle Peak being the highest peak in the race at 9,109 ft.

The ridge lines are where my mood finally started to shift. The soil is silty up there, and there are a lot of areas that if you aren't willing and skilled enough to send, are grueling and take forever to make it through.

I fell a few times. I became irritated with the terrain. I wanted to hang out with my friends and go have a nice dinner, especially since they were most definitely going to be pulled from the race at this point. And, it was at this time I got it in my head that I was going to quit. My next aid station would be my last.

- the doctor catches up to me, thanks me for stopping earlier, and tells me about the trail a bit and what's up ahead. I'm slowing down. My thoughts aren't as positive by this point. This is a hard fucking race.
- I start slipping. Crap. Scree. Fuck. By this point I'm not as positive as I once was, especially after the slip on the way to the bottom. This is where I really start letting my positive mindset slow, and letting the thoughts of dropping at the next aid station.
- me and the doctor talk again ... I didn't realize we were so close to the cutoff or I probably would have picked it up, but ... he is going for it ... he is deadset on making the cutoff ... sometimes I wonder what's going through people's heads, why they are so adamant about pushing through -- what drives them (I'd find out later).

I didn't even realize that I was getting close to the cut-off time. Apparently they gave us an extra hour. Without it there is no way I would have even been close, but with it ...

And then Dave ? What's his name? came along once again. He could tell I was having a bad time on the peak. And he said maybe the most encouraging words to me, something to the effect of "hey let's grab something to eat together in Castle Valley before we head off."

He would make the cut-off, I would not.

## Post-Race.

It's a very different mental experience quitting your own race versus being pulled from it.

I knew I had a while to wait, given that Jourdan and Ray were going to take a while to come in. I sat against a tree, called my wife and talked to her as long as it made sense to do so.

I wasn't really bummed at this point, I was more happy that I was going to get to have dinner with my friends. And we did. And we had a great time.

It wasn't until a day after the race that I felt the significance of getting pulled from the race within my body. I was fucking bummed. And I was bummed because I knew I didn't give it my best. I didn't give it my best leading up to the race, and I didn't give it my best on the day. I allowed very minor issues to drive my thoughts into the negative and then I began diving into the narrative of stopping at the next aid station.

I'd had my fun. It was time to go spend time with friends. Everyone else had dropped by this point, so it would just be me out there. Fuck.


## Thoughts.

It wasn't until the next day that the reality of the situation really set in. I was bummed. Super bummed. It's often that when I talk about things saying that they are no big deal, that it's a REALLY FUCKING BIG DEAL. I tend to talk-down big things, I guess to ease the pain if they don't work out.

But that's the thing. It doesn't ease the pain. The strategy doesn't work at all. It's a farse. It's a big fucking lie.

Castle Peak was a reminder of how important it is to know thyself. A reminder to consistently check-in to my body when I'm in conversation. How does what I'm saying make me feel? And as a result, a reminder to tell myself the fucking truth.

- know yourself.
- physical limits. mental limits.
- feel the lies.
- tell the truth.

I spent a good portion of the summer traveling around the southwest. Sometimes by myself. Sometimes with others. Always a good time.
