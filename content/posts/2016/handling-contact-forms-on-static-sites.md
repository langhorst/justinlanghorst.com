I originally went the route of rolling my own contact form handler. But instead of setting up my own server (even if mostly already written the way I would want it, see [contact-form](https://github.com/jmoiron/contact-form/) on GitHub), daemonizing it, proxying requests from Nginx, and then remembering how I set it all up 6 months from now, I found another service.

[FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/) look awesome, but their lowest pricing option is way more expensive than I need for a paltry little contact form on a site that barely gets any traffic.

Continuing my search, I found [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). Free for 1,000 submissions a month. It handles my personal [contact form] perfectly. They also offer an upgraded membership option for $10/month and the whole thing is open source if you care to host your own copy.

And now Iâ€™m tempted to go write my own generic form handler written in Golang. Another day.
