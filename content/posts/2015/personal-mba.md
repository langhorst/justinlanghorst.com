I've always found the whole idea of a master's degree in business admisinistration interesting. It's one of those things that I'd like to have, but only if the price is right. I certainly can't justify spending over a hundred grand to obtain one from a reputable university.

What I REALLY want is the knowledge. I can't think of very many reasons to have a certificate saying that I went through a few years of school to obtain knowledge that I could have largely gotten from the public library. So I've taken the DIY approach - the [Personal MBA](http://personalmba.com).

The Personal MBA is a list of good business books that cover the topics that you would learn in business school. That's it. Just a list of books. But, it's a well curated list of books with at least yearly updates since its inception.

For the past few years I've been reading a book from the list here and there, but never seriously committed to finishing the "degree." The past few months I've gotten a bit more serious about reading more and more from the list. Now I need a place to put my notes, and that place is here.
